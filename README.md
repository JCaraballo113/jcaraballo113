I am a lover of all things code with a focus in JavaScript technologies. I have professional experience with the technologies listed below.

Currently the Director of software engineering at [Covey](https://covey.io/) where we are trying to create the future for retail investors. Seriously, check it out!

My goal for this year is to become more involved in the Web Development technologies through the creation of content. This includes blog posts, videos, podcasts and more!
